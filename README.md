A paper exploring the connectome of a larval Drosophila

## Repo structure 
- ``.github``: Files specifying how the repo behaves on GitHub
- ``data``: Directory to store the raw data. 
- ``docs``: Files to build the documentation website in the form of a [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/intro.html)
- ``pkg``: A local Python package used for analysis in the Jupyter Notebooks

<!-- ## Usage

### Building the book

If you'd like to develop on and build the Maggot connectome book, you should:

- Clone this repository and run
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (it is recommended you do this within a virtual environment)
- (Recommended) Remove the existing `Maggot connectome/_build/` directory
- Run `jupyter-book build Maggot connectome/`

A fully-rendered HTML version of the book will be built in `Maggot connectome/_build/html/`.

### Hosting the book

The html version of the book is hosted on the `gh-pages` branch of this repo. A GitHub actions workflow has been created that automatically builds and pushes the book to this branch on a push or pull request to main.

If you wish to disable this automation, you may remove the GitHub actions workflow and build the book manually by:

- Navigating to your local build; and running,
- `ghp-import -n -p -f Maggot connectome/_build/html`

This will automatically push your build to the `gh-pages` branch. More information on this hosting process can be found [here](https://jupyterbook.org/publish/gh-pages.html#manually-host-your-book-with-github-pages).
